# Aftercodecs
Render codecs for After Affects
Now macOS OS X compatible!
Two new plugins in the dropdown : “AfterCodecs .mp4” and “AfterCodecs .mov”. There’s no more .ext and file renaming stuff (Removed the “Overwriting” options in Settings because not needed anymore)
You can choose ProRes 4444 Alpha depth now : 16 bits or 8 bits (smaller files, faster decompression)
Enabled lossless for x265 (same as x264 : 99 for 422, 100 for 444)
AfterCodecs will warn you if the width or the height are odd instead of displaying the generic error popup
2 New shortcuts : ESC to exit AfterCodecs dialog, Shift+ESC to reposition it in the top left corner (use theses shortcuts if you have trouble with multiple screens for example)
ProRes 422 Bitrate matches more closely official Apple ProRes bitrate than before, and are now re importable back into AE on OSX
